Our Fellows support the integration of BehSci insights and methods into priority program and policy areas within each of their departments.</p>
                        <p>While our team members have diverse academic backgrounds and an array of methodological specialties, we all share a passion for understanding human behaviour and using that understanding to drive change. Combining our knowledge of the literature with cutting-edge research and experimentation practices is what we do best.</p>

                                        <p>She is currently supporting central team projects and initiatives, including the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO Canada) study. Previously, Amanda was a Fellow at the RCMP where she focused on enhancing the psychological support services given to members who work in covert operations. Amanda has a Master’s degree in Experimental Psychology from Laurentian University and in 2018 earned a PhD in Social Psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University where she studied mindfulness and its impact on mental health. For Amanda, the most meaningful part of her role is using insights from the BehSci literature to help inform innovative approaches as well as helping to build capacity for BehSci in line departments.</p>
                                        <p>Currently inspired by…..I am constantly inspired by the research coming out of the global BehSci community. It is always helpful to see how the principles of BehSci are being used to help solve complex problems both in and out of Government around the world.</p>

Kyle joined the Fellowship Program in early 2019 after completing a PhD in Educational Psychology from McGill University. For Kyle, the best part of his role is getting to learn from and work with such an amazing collection of people both at the IIU and ECCC.</p>

                                        <p>Currently Recommending… What Works: Gender Equality by Design by Iris Bohnet is one of my favourite BehSci books.
