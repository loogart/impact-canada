                        <h2>Partnering with the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise</h2>
                        <h3>Collaborating with the Centre of Expertise</h3>
                        <p>The Impact Canada Centre of Expertise is a small team of subject matter and technical experts that support the development and implementation of innovative approaches to address complex public policy problems.</p>
                        <p>The Centre of Expertise provides customized support to federal organizations through a co-design approach, adapted to the organizational readiness of the federal partner. The team assists federal organizations through challenge ideation planning to execution, as necessary, and provides guidance in applying the highest standards of rigour in program design and implementation. Being at the centre of government, the Centre of Expertise is uniquely positioned to bridge partnerships across organizational boundaries.</p>
                        <p>The Centre of Expertise also provides access to key resources that support federal partners to implement innovative methods, including providing support to help federal organizations use the Impact Canada Terms and Conditions or alternative flexible funding mechanism; a Fellowship program; and a centralized web platform supported by in-house visual and graphic design experts. These tools and supports offer Impact Canada partners the ability to more effectively and efficiently design and launch high-impact challenges..</p>
                        <p>The Impact Canada model also enables federal partners to build internal capacity to implement innovative tools. While only three years into implementation, early insights point to the mix of centralized and distributed expertise as a success factor in the delivery of challenges in a federal government context.</p>

                        <p>The Fellowship program provides Impact Canada with a mechanism to extend its supports to organizations in the face of increasing demand of specialized skills. The Fellowship program recruits external talent with expertise in four discrete disciplines – behavioural science, impact measurement, innovative finance, and challenges. Fellows remain Privy Council Office employees throughout their placements in host organizations, ensuring a valuable connection to Impact Canada. Placements typically range from 12-24 months, depending on individual project scope. The Challenge Prize stream is currently being tested in two federal departments.</p>

                        <p>The Impact Canada Terms and Conditions for innovative funding are a key tool for federal partner organizations who are governed by the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments applies to most federal government departments and agencies’ funding instruments. Transfer payments are: “a monetary payment, or a transfer of goods, services or assets made, on the basis of an appropriation, to a third party... that does not result in the acquisition by the Government of Canada of any goods, services or assets. Transfer payments are categorized as grants, contributions and other transfer payments. Transfer payments do not include investments, loans or loan guarantees.”</p>
                        <p>Federal partner organizations can draw on all or only some of the authorities contained in the Terms and Conditions depending on what the challenge design process requires. This is determined through a Terms and Conditions analysis undertaken by the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise during program stream or individual project conception, in collaboration with the accountable federal organization.</p>
                        <p>While the Terms and Conditions are a significant step forward in more modern program management within the Government of Canada, they present a number of complexities in managing innovative funding approaches within traditionally more rigid departmental structures and cultures.</p>
                        <p>An observed best practice has seen potential federal partners seek early engagement with the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise, as well as their own internal corporate, financial, and legal services on these flexibilities. This collaborative approach has helped determine and co-design the most appropriate funding and program management approaches.</p>
                        <p>The Impact Canada Terms and Conditions provide a broad range of authorities, flexibilities, and exceptions to this Policy to support outcomes-based funding. The most important features pertaining to challenges are the ability to:</p>
