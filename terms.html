                <p>This notice has been written to explain how Privy Council Office and sponsoring departments interact with the public on social media platforms. </p>
                <h3>Content and Frequency</h3>
                <p>We use our social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on our website and interacting with our stakeholders.

                <p>Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a third party, our social media accounts are subject to downtime that may be out of our control. As such, we accept no responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.</p>

                <h3>Following, "Favouriting" and Subscribing</h3>
                <p>Our decision to "follow," "favourite" or "subscribe" to another social media account does not imply an endorsement of that account, channel, page or site, and neither does sharing (re-tweeting, reposting or linking to) content from another user.</p>
                <h3>Comments and Interaction</h3>
                <p>We will read comments and participate in discussions when appropriate. We ask that your comments be relevant and respectful. We reserve the right to delete comments that violate this notice, and the user may be blocked and reported to prevent further inappropriate comments.</p>

                <p>We may share links that direct users to sites of organizations or other entities that are not subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html" target="_blank">Official Languages Act</a> and available only in the language(s) in which they are written.
