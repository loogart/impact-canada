                    <p>The Food Waste Reduction Challenge has been designed with four distinct streams. Applications
                        to Stream A and B closed on January 18, 2021. This guide focuses on the application intake
                        for Streams C and D.</p>
                    pEach stream of the Challenge consists of three stages. Once selected, semi-finalists from Stage
                    1 will receive further reporting requirements and instructions for Stage 2.

                        <h2>1.0 About the Food Waste Reduction Challenge</h2>
                        <p>One third of all food produced globally for human consumption goes to waste. This food
                            accounts for about one quarter of all water used by the agriculture sector each year,
                            requires land area greater than the size of China, and generates around 8% of global
                            greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, largely from food waste decomposing in
                            landfills. Approximately 31% of Canada’s food supply is wasted annually, costing an
                            estimated $49.5 billion. Meanwhile, one in seven Canadians suffer from food insecurity.
                        </p>
                        <p>The economic, social and environmental footprint of food waste is too large to ignore.
                            That is why the Government of Canada is launching the Food Waste Reduction Challenge,
                            under the <a
                                href="https://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-our-department/key-departmental-initiatives/food-policy/?id=1597858160271"
                                target="_blank">Food Policy for Canada</a>, an initiative which serves as a roadmap
                            for a healthier and more sustainable food system for Canada.</p>

                                    <p>The Challenge aims to support new innovations and solutions which can help
                                        address the problem of food waste and loss across the supply chain, thereby
                                        reducing the associated economic, environmental, and social costs of food
                                        waste. Collectively, these solutions will help increase food availability,
                                        save consumers and businesses money, reduce GHG emissions and improve the
                                        efficiency of the food sector. </p>

                                        perishable foods to reduce the creation of food waste by slowing the
                                        degradation mechanism of specific perishable food items and extending the
                                        length of time these food items may be stored without becoming unsuitable
                                        for use or consumption. </p>
                                    <p><strong>Stream D</strong> D focuses on technologies that transform food waste
                                        by converting surplus food, food by-products, or food waste into other
                                        products, including: food for humans, food for animals/insects (e.g. animal
                                        feed), or non-food products.</p>

                                    <p>A <strong>challenge prize</strong> competition presents a clear problem or objective and offers a reward to the first or best solution to the problem, as judged by a panel of experts, based on a set of pre-determined criteria. Challenge prizes work best in addressing problems that are stuck or in domains that are new and emerging. In both scenarios, they serve to accelerate solutions and to bring new perspectives and approaches forward.</p>
                                    <p>For the purpose of this Challenge, <strong>food waste</strong> is defined as inclusive of any type of food loss and waste that occurs at any stage of the food supply chain from farms to consumers. It refers to all food or part of food that is grown, harvested, processed, manufactured or prepared for human consumption, but never eaten by people. </p>
                                    <p>The <strong>food supply chain</strong> is the network of actors and processes that describe how food moves from production to our tables. This network includes: farms and food production sites; post-harvest handling and storage; food processing and manufacturing facilities; distribution and transportation networks; grocery retail; food service industry such as restaurants and institutional canteens; and consumers at home.</p>
                                    <p>Examples of food loss and waste across the food supply chain are illustrated in the figure below:</p>

                                            <p>This diagram depicts a circle illustrating the food supply chain as a cycle. The circle is divided into five sections, with icons representing each of the following section: food production (represented as a farm), handing and distribution (represented as a truck), food processing and manufacturing (represented as a factory), grocery retail (represented as a shopping cart) and food service as well as households and consumers (represented by a fork and knife). In the middle of the circle is a garbage can surrounded by two circular arrows indicating that food waste occurs at all stages of the food cycle. Outside the circle, the figure lists examples of food waste across each stage of the food supply chain. Under food production, it lists: unharvested fruits and vegetables; and undersized crops that cannot be sold. Under handling and distribution, it lists: crops incorrectly stored; and produce bruised in transportation. Under food processing and manufacturing, it lists: damage or spilling of food during processing or manufacturing. Under grocery retail, it lists: excess inventory that spoils or is not moved in due time. Under food service, it lists: excess food on plates; and food not served. Under households and consumers, it lists: products thrown away early due to conservative best before date.</p>

                                    <p>Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is a widely-used indicator of degree of development of a technology toward deployment on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being fully deployment-ready. For more information on Technology Readiness Levels, please visit https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/080.nsf/eng/00002.html. </p>
                                    <p>For Streams C and D in this Challenge, there is no TRL requirement at the application stage (Stage 1). However, all applicants are required to achieve or exceed TRL milestones at Stage 2 (Level 5) and Stage 3 (Level 7). The descriptions for those two levels are included below:</p>
                                    <strong>Level 5: Component and/or validation in a simulated environment</strong>
                                    <p>The basic technological components are integrated for testing in a simulated environment. Activities include laboratory integration of components.</p>

                                    <p>The purpose of this question is to allow you to concisely and precisely make your case for how your solution responds to the Challenge statements for Stream C (i.e. Advance technologies that make perishable foods last longer; preserve food quality, safety, and nutritional value; and prevent food waste) or Stream D (i.e. Advance technologies that transform food waste, food by-products and/or surplus food into new foods or other products). Remember that the purpose of these two streams is to make significant advances with respect to novel technologies. Include a brief description for how your technology works and how is it different than existing technologies. Please also remember that the external review committee (i.e. “the jury”) is composed of a diverse group of professionals covering different areas of expertise. Accordingly, you should use simple language in your answer and avoid the use of highly technical language to ensure you are addressing the broad diversity of expertise and backgrounds of the external review committee. </p>

                                            <p>In this question, you should assess the economic benefit of your solution compared to its development and deployment cost. You should identify and describe the type of economic value created by your solution. This economic value might be directly linked to savings from food waste reduction, but there could be other economic benefits generated by your solution to end users and to food systems, in general. Try to quantify those financial returns to end users and other stakeholders in the food system, as applicable. In parallel, you should quantify and estimate costs associated with your solution. These cost values will not be used to determine funding amounts from the Challenge, but are important for the purpose of assessing the economic and financial feasibility, profitability and sustainability of your solution. You need to determine two types of costs: 1) costs associated with the development and commercialization of the solution that you, as a solution developer will bear, and 2) costs associated with acquiring and using your solution that end users are expected to bear. Compare those costs with the financial returns to justify the business and economic case for your solution.</p>
