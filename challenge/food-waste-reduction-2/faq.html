                                <p>We invite you to also consult the Applicant Guide for Streams C and D. The Guide is
                                    designed to explain the process, the terms and conditions, and include detailed
                                    instructions on how to complete the Application Form.</p>

                                    <h3>2.	Why is AAFC using a challenge to address food waste?</h3>
                                </summary>
                                <p>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is constantly seeking new ways to fuel innovation using all available tools. This challenge opens up the problem-solving process to new innovators who can bring fresh perspectives and new ideas to a long-standing and complex issue such as food waste. Challenge Prizes are outcomes-based: they shift the emphasis from paying for eligible costs of an approved project towards paying for results to solve problems.</p>
                                <p>It is useful to think of Challenge Prizes as an ‘innovation search engine’ with the competition and prizes acting as a catalyst to mobilize new talent from outside traditional communities and to surface new thinking, perspectives, and ideas. While the Challenge is inherently focused on identifying grand winners, the diversity of innovations and potential collaborations that emerge from the process allow for the establishment of a visible and better connected network of innovators working to solve food waste in Canada.</p>
                                <p>In addition to the Challenge, AAFC is also undertaking other initiatives to reduce food waste in Canada, including a $6.3 million investment towards the Federal Leadership in Food Waste Reduction Initiative, through which the government will foster engagement and collaboration around food waste, reduce food waste in federal activities, and facilitate reporting on food loss and waste in Canada.</p>

                                </summary>
                                <p>For Streams C and D, the Challenge is looking to advance novel technologies that prevent or divert food loss and waste, across any segment of the food supply chain.  Proposed solutions need to leverage innovation and technology advancement to achieve the outcomes identified in the following challenge statements:</p>
                                <p><strong>STREAM C - Technologies that Extend the Life of Food</strong>Advance technologies that make perishable foods last longer; preserve food quality, safety, and nutritional value; and prevent food waste.</p>
                                <p><strong>STREAM D - Technologies that Transform Food Waste</strong>Advance technologies that transform food waste, food by-products and/or surplus food into new foods or other value-added products.</p>

                                    <h3>4.	How are you defining food waste and the food supply chain?</h3>
                                </summary>
                                <p>For the purpose of this Challenge, ‘food waste’ means any type of food loss and waste that occurs at any stage of the food supply chain from farms to consumers. It refers to all food or part of food that is grown, harvested, processed, manufactured or prepared for human consumption, but never eaten by people. </p>
                                <p>The food supply chain is the network of actors and processes that moves food from production to our tables. This network includes: farms and food production sites; post-harvest handling and storage; food processing and manufacturing facilities; distribution and transportation networks; grocery retail; food service industry such as restaurants and institutional canteens; and consumers at home.</p>
                                <p>The Challenge is looking for any solution to food loss and waste across any segment of the food supply chain from farm to table. However, applicants are encouraged to consider how their solutions interact across multiple segments of the food supply chain (for example: are you transferring the problem from one segment to another?). Solutions that are more holistic in nature, taking into consideration food waste across multiple segments of the supply chain are encouraged.</p>

                                </summary>
                                <p>There are several financial incentives for participating in the Challenge. For Streams C and D, based on the concept application, semi-finalists will be awarded approximately $100K in prize funding at the first stage of the Challenge, and will be invited to participate in Stage 2. Finalists will receive up to an additional $450K and will be invite to move to Stage 3; and two grand prize winners will receive up to an additional $1M at the end of the Challenge.</p>
                                <p>TParticipation in the Challenge not only presents the possibility of receiving new funding for your solution, it is also the opportunity to gain visibility and profile your innovation in Canada and more broadly. It is a chance to have your solution evaluated on its technical and non-technical merits (e.g. business value) by a range of experts. Other non-financial incentives include networking opportunities facilitated by AAFC and capacity-building opportunities. </p>

                                <p>Yes, provided you meet the requirements of both programs and the terms and conditions of your funding agreements. Under the Food Waste Reduction Challenge, there are no stacking limits (i.e. maximum level of total Canadian government funding that is to be permitted for any activity, project, or initiative of a recipient), but applicants would be subject to any applicable stacking limits imposed by other federal, provincial, or municipal funding programs and/or partners. If you have additional questions about funding terms and conditions under the Food Waste Reduction Challenge, please <a href="mailto:aafc.fwrc-drga.aac@canada.ca">contact us</a>.

                                <p>Yes, a single applicant can have multiple ideas/solutions and accordingly apply to multiple challenge streams or submit multiple applications to the same challenge stream. Applicants to Streams A and B who have an innovative solution to Streams C and D are encouraged to apply. However, only one solution per applicant may be selected for the Challenge. Try our <a href="https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/food-waste-reduction-challenge/stream-selection-tool" target="_blank">interactive tool</a> to help you identify which stream is the best fit for you. Note that the application intake for streams A and B are closed.

                                    <p>You should not submit multiple applications for the same idea/solution. If you have a technical issue with your application, please contact <a href="mailto:aafc.fwrc-drga.aac@canada.ca">contact us</a>.</p>

Additional expertise from other government departments may be sought in the review process, based on application content.</p>
                                <p>AAFC will ensure that any real or perceived conflict of interest regarding external review committee members or others involved in the assessment process is disclosed and mitigated, and will execute non-disclosure agreements to protect the confidential information of applicants.</p>
