                            <p>The Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative aims to accelerate effective change by
                                inspiring and harnessing Indigenous innovation and knowledge, recognizing that the best
                                solutions come from Indigenous peoples who live their own needs every day. The
                                Initiative goes beyond existing Government of Canada’s housing programs, and emphasizes
                                community priorities, innovative ideas, and new partnerships. It also supports a
                                wrap-around approach to the refinement of proposals and concepts that have promise of
                                positive impact but have yet to be fully developed.

                                service reform, and how a challenge prize model needs to be adapted to better suit an
                                Indigenous context.</p>

                            <h3>2.1 About Impact Canada</h3>
                            <p>Impact Canada, launched in the fall of 2017, drives public sector innovation by
                                supporting the implementation of high-priority programs, projects and services designed
                                to improve outcomes for citizens. It is a vehicle whereby the Government of Canada can
                                test innovations and generate evidence of which efforts work best to create greater
                                public value in high priority areas.</p>
                            <p>Led out of the Privy Council Office of Canada, it is part of a growing international
                                trend to have dedicated innovation organizations focused on improving outcomes at the
                                centre of government. It champions the application of outcomes-based approaches using
                                innovation methods such as challenges, behavioral insights, and pay-for-success funding,
                                backed by rigorous evaluations. </p>

                            <h3>2.2 Why a Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Challenge Prizes are unique public policy tools that allow governments to identify
                                problems and reward those who solve them. </p>
                            <p>Challenges are an open innovation approach, meaning that they are designed to crowd-in
                                innovative ideas and solutions from a wide variety of actors and sources to expand the
                                Government’s problem-solving abilities. Challenges are designed to have a “look and
                                feel” that is different from the types of funding programs that governments and their
                                stakeholders are accustomed to running and participating in. </p>

                                        <p>Challenges provide incentives (both financial and non-financial) to encourage
                                            a broad range of innovators to tackle problems where solutions are not
                                            apparent, or current responses are not achieving the desired results.
                                            Incentives are typically structured through a stage-gated approach, where
                                            challenge participants receive incentives at different stages of the
                                            challenge.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Challenges aim to solve big problems and accelerate progress towards
                                            ambitious goals and have a history of producing major breakthroughs in human
                                            knowledge and practice. They do this by shining a powerful light on an issue
                                            or opportunity and providing an incentive for innovators to prioritize the
                                            challenge goal.</p>

                                empower Indigenous peoples to independently deliver services and address the
                                socio-economic conditions in their communities, with the objective of gradually giving
                                effect to the transfer of services to Indigenous partners.

                            <p>The Housing and Infrastructure Service Reform Directorate at ISC is working towards
                                transforming the delivery of infrastructure services, programs and resources. The
                                Housing and Infrastructure Service Reform Directorate worked with Indigenous partners to
                                launch the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative, with the ultimate goal of applying
                                key insights from the Initiative to the broader policy reforms taking place in
                                Indigenous housing and infrastructure.</p>

                            <h3>3.1 Why the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative?</h3>
                            <p>Indigenous peoples experience some of the worst living conditions in Canada, and limited
                                access to transitional or supportive housing options; the last several years have seen
                                broad consensus that federal Indigenous housing programs are not working, and need to be
                                substantively transformed.</p>
                            <p>Given the immediate housing issues that Indigenous communities face, ISC’s current
                                housing funding – provided under the Capital Facilities and Maintenance Program - is
                                used primarily for immediate needs and rapid construction in on-reserve communities. In

                                geographic and cultural settings for which they are intended. Indigenous partners have
                                identified the need to test innovative solutions that may support systemic long-term
                                change and improvements to current programming – difficult to do given the existing
                                pressures. </p>

                                        <p>Impact Canada has also explored new models for Indigenous innovation as part
                                            of a broader Government of Canada effort to seek new approaches to build
                                            partnerships with Indigenous communities to improve outcomes in relevant
                                            ways. For example, the <a

                                        <p>Indigenous initiatives open a door to exploring ways to advance the
                                            relationship with Indigenous peoples in Canada, partnering directly with
                                            Indigenous experts to address barriers and exploring ways to effectively
                                            accommodate cultural perspectives with sensitivity, humility and compassion
                                            to re-shape the colonized approaches that historically defined Canada. </p>

                                            initiatives under Impact Canada rely less on the competitive aspects in
                                            favor of a more holistic, community-oriented frame that values
                                            interconnection and communal values over individual triumphs. Impact Canada
                                            is currently examining the features of these approaches that are both
                                            similar and distinct from traditional challenge-based programs.</p>
                                        <p>They aim to bring forward ideas inspired by Indigenous knowledge and ways of
                                            being, regardless of their stage of development, while finding pathways to
                                            develop these into sustainable solutions that can have meaningful, positive
                                            impacts on Indigenous communities.</p>
                                        <p>The Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative was initially conceived similar to
                                            a prize challenge – where innovators would submit ideas and compete for
                                            prize funding to implement them. Indigenous partners quickly told the
                                            Government of Canada this model did not align with Indigenous priorities or
                                            values, highlighting the following:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Indigenous innovation comes from access to collaborative networks, not
                                                competition;
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Rather than awarding prizes for good ideas, there is a need to place
                                                greater emphasis on developing these ideas – the main barrier to the
                                                construction of housing that is designed by and for Indigenous
                                                communities; and,
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Indigenous people must define this initiative rather than the Government
                                                of Canada.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>After integrating these crucial design elements, the Indigenous Homes
                                            Innovation Initiative was launched in April 2019. </p>

                                in a flexible and collaborative funding environment. Through Impact Canada, the
                                following flexibilities were accessed to try a new approach to the delivery of housing

                            <h3>5.1 Effective and Efficient Government: the Original Rationale for the Initiative</h3>
                            <h4>5.1.1 Reforming the ISC Housing Service Delivery Model</h4>
                            <p>ISC’s current funding approach for housing is needs-based and focused on health and
                                safety and is limited to an on reserve context (for First Nations). Funding cannot
                                typically be used for projects that generate community revenue nor does it integrate
                                well with other programming that focus on social supports (i.e. wrap around services).
                                The Initiative pilots an outcomes-based approach to housing that allows greater
                                flexibility of funding – where Indigenous people identify why their proposed approach
                                will lead to better outcomes in community wellbeing, and spend their funding
                                accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The Initiative also focuses on finding ways to make it easier for Indigenous peoples to
                                live in safe, appropriate homes. For example, a significant proportion of First Nation
                                individuals live off-reserve and are largely ineligible for targeted federal
                                infrastructure programming. To address this, the Initiative accepted applications from
                                Indigenous organizations and individuals offering housing ideas that addressed the needs
                                of First Nations living on or off reserve, Inuit and Metis.</p>

                                        <p>While not an intended outcome, the initial conception of the initiative as a
                                            ‘challenge’ sparked public conversation about the federal government’s
                                            approach to Indigenous housing. Coverage by media outlets such as CBC
                                            referenced ‘the Hunger Games of Indigenous housing’ and thought leaders such
                                            as Indigenous lawyer and professor Pamela Palmater weighed in; Palmater was
                                            interviewed by Aboriginal People’s Television Network and the Senior
                                            Director of Housing and Infrastructure at ISC was subsequently interviewed
                                            as well. Chiefs, notably in Ontario, expressed their views to the federal
                                            government and in the media – in Ontario, Chief Shining Turtle of Whitefish
                                            River First Nation was adamantly opposed to the challenge while Chief
                                            Maracle of Mohawks Bay of Quinte announced his community would submit an
                                            application. Public discussion focused on the historic level of investment
                                            in Indigenous housing, and the competitive mechanism. In this way, the
                                            federal government had an unanticipated and difficult but ultimately
                                            productive engagement on the issue.</p>

                                        pNew talent has certainly been mobilized through the cohort of 24 innovators
                                        selected to participate. The group is a range of innovators from across the
                                        country – from seasoned housing developers, to Chiefs, to social service
                                        delivery practitioners, to individuals who simply have good ideas. For new
                                        entrants to the area, resources provided include project coordination funding,
                                        hands-on mentorship from Indigenous architects and funding to engage their
                                        communities and refine their ideas into an implementable proposal, while
                                        expanding their skills and expertise. Notably, one project is assisted by
                                        Indigenous architecture students from the University of Manitoba; with a
                                        dedicated focus on Indigenous elements of architecture.

                                            private and not-for-profit sectors. These new partnership models intend to
                                            provide mentorship and capacity building and support. This approach aims to

                                        <p>The Initiative aims to increase community self-determination, resilience,
                                            capacity, and economic development and potentially leverage funds to
                                            complement the Government of Canada’s investment of up to $2 million for
                                            implementation of each of the selected projects. The Initiative aims to
                                            support housing ideas that decrease dependency on external resources,
                                            strengthen local economies by sourcing local labour and materials, and
                                            create jobs. This includes project ideas using alternative building
                                            materials and decreasing energy costs and environmental impacts. Skills and
                                            capacity development were built directly into the Initiative design at the
                                            direction of the Steering Committee in two concrete ways:</p>

                                            <li>one of the six focus areas for the Initiative focused on ‘using the home
                                                for empowerment, capacity building and support for local businesses’;

                                            Accelerator is a significant capacity-building opportunity. Innovators have
                                            been paired with mentors to develop their ideas over the course of up to 18
                                            months.

                                            enabled ISC to express its broader shared objective to transfer services to
                                            Indigenous communities. From start to finish, the Initiative was developed,

                                                comprised of six prominent Indigenous individuals with expertise in
                                                Indigenous housing from across Canada. The Indigenous Steering Committee
                                                members were involved in the design of the Initiative, from identifying

                            <p>Through the Initiative, ISC and its partners have tried a number of service delivery
                                aspects that are new to the Department. This presents an opportunity for ISC to learn
                                and improve service delivery in its main housing and infrastructure program. Key
                                questions to track through to 2023 and beyond include whether:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>an initiative designed by an Indigenous Steering Committee resulted in services that
                                    are more likely to respond to communities’ needs and priorities;</li>
                                <li>increased flexibility of terms and conditions made innovators more likely to achieve
                                    their intended outcomes, and notably whether these outcomes go beyond what the
                                    Capital Facilities and Maintenance Program can deliver (such as revenue generation,
                                    welcoming urban spaces, or transitional and supportive housing for vulnerable
                                    populations).

                                <li>the Accelerator’s gated process, that puts an emphasis on impact through design,
                                    made for designs and Operations and Maintenance plans that out-performed standard
                                    construction housing in terms of years of use, maintenance and energy needs, or

                                <li>the network-building approach taken through the Accelerator has resulted in leverage
                                    of in-kind services in a sustainable manner that should be scaled up;</li>
