                            <h3>2.1 About Impact Canada</h3>
                            <p>Impact Canada, launched in the fall of 2017, drives public sector innovation by supporting the implementation of high-priority programs, projects and services designed to improve outcomes for citizens. It is a vehicle whereby the Government of Canada can test innovations and generate evidence of which efforts work best to create greater public value in high priority areas.</p>
                            <p>Led out of the Privy Council Office of Canada, it is part of a growing international trend to have dedicated innovation organizations focused on improving outcomes at the centre of government. It champions the application of outcomes-based approaches using innovation methods such as challenges, behavioral insights, and pay-for-success funding, backed by rigorous evaluations. </p>

                            <h3>2.2 Why a Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Challenge Prizes are unique public policy tools that allow governments to identify problems and reward those who solve them. </p>
                            <p>Challenges are an open innovation approach, meaning that they are designed to crowd-in innovative ideas and solutions from a wide variety of actors and sources to expand the Government’s problem-solving abilities. Challenges are designed to have a “look and feel” that is different from the types of funding programs that governments and their stakeholders are accustomed to running and participating in. </p>

                                        <p>Challenges provide incentives (both financial and non-financial) to encourage a broad range of innovators to tackle problems where solutions are not apparent, or current responses are not achieving the desired results. Incentives are typically structured through a stage-gated approach, where challenge participants receive incentives at different stages of the challenge.                                            
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Challenges aim to solve big problems and accelerate progress towards ambitious goals and have a history of producing major breakthroughs in human knowledge and practice. They do this by shining a powerful light on an issue or opportunity and providing an incentive for innovators to prioritize the challenge goal.</p>

                            <p>Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) is the lead department for the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative. ISC works collaboratively with partners to improve access to high quality services for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. Their vision is to support and empower Indigenous peoples to independently deliver services and address the socio-economic conditions in their communities, with the objective of gradually giving effect to the transfer of services to Indigenous partners. 
                            </p>

                            <p>The Housing and Infrastructure Service Reform Directorate at ISC is working towards transforming the delivery of infrastructure services, programs and resources. The Housing and Infrastructure Service Reform Directorate worked with Indigenous partners to launch the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative, with the ultimate goal of applying key insights from the Initiative to the broader policy reforms taking place in Indigenous housing and infrastructure.</p>

                            <h3>3.1 Why the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative?</h3>
                            <p>Indigenous peoples experience some of the worst living conditions in Canada, and limited access to transitional or supportive housing options; the last several years have seen broad consensus that federal Indigenous housing programs are not working, and need to be substantively transformed.</p>
                            <p>Given the immediate housing issues that Indigenous communities face, ISC’s current housing funding –  provided under the Capital Facilities and Maintenance Program -  is used primarily for immediate needs and rapid construction in on-reserve communities. In this context, building designs are not always well adapted to the full spectrum of geographic and cultural settings for which they are intended. Indigenous partners have identified the need to test innovative solutions that may support systemic long-term change and improvements to current programming – difficult to do given the existing pressures. </p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">

                                        <p>Impact Canada has also explored new models for Indigenous innovation as part of a broader Government of Canada effort to seek new approaches to build partnerships with Indigenous communities to improve outcomes in relevant ways. For example, the <a href="https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/off-diesel" target="_blank">Indigenous Off Diesel Initiative</a>, led by Natural Resources Canada, will support Clean Energy Champions and their communities with tailored clean energy training, access to expertise and financial resources to develop and start implementing an ambitious diesel reduction plan. 
                                          
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Indigenous initiatives open a door to exploring ways to advance the relationship with Indigenous peoples in Canada, partnering directly with Indigenous experts to address barriers and exploring ways to effectively accommodate cultural perspectives with sensitivity, humility and compassion to re-shape the colonized approaches that historically defined Canada. </p>
                                        <p>Borrowing elements from challenge-based approaches, Indigenous innovation initiatives under Impact Canada rely less on the competitive aspects in favor of a more holistic, community-oriented frame that values interconnection and communal values over individual triumphs. Impact Canada is currently examining the features of these approaches that are both similar and distinct from traditional challenge-based programs.</p>
                                        <p>They aim to bring forward ideas inspired by Indigenous knowledge and ways of being, regardless of their stage of development, while finding pathways to develop these into sustainable solutions that can have meaningful, positive impacts on Indigenous communities.</p>
                                        <p>The Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative was initially conceived similar to a prize challenge – where innovators would submit ideas and compete for prize funding to implement them. Indigenous partners quickly told the Government of Canada this model did not align with Indigenous priorities or values, highlighting the following:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Indigenous innovation comes from access to collaborative networks, not competition;
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Rather than awarding prizes for good ideas, there is a need to place greater emphasis on developing these ideas – the main barrier to the construction of housing that is designed by and for Indigenous communities; and,
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Indigenous people must define this initiative rather than the Government of Canada.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>After integrating these crucial design elements, the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative was launched in April 2019. </p>

                            <h3>4.1 Leveraging the Impact Canada Terms and Conditions</h3>
                            <p>The Impact Canada Terms and Conditions provide an ideal way to explore changes to ISC housing programs; rather than make sweeping changes to federal funding authorities, the Terms and Conditions have been used to invite Indigenous people to provide their ideas in a flexible and collaborative funding environment. Through Impact Canada, the following flexibilities were accessed to try a new approach to the delivery of housing services for Indigenous communities:</p>                            
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li>

                                        <summary><h4>Exemption to the Policy on Transfer Payments to allow outcomes-based rather than project-based funding</h4></summary>
                                        <p>ISC funding has been allotted to projects in collaboration with Indigenous experts based on the capacity needs of the project leads and the forecast costs of the project – rather than a list of eligible expenditures;
                                        </p>                                       
                                    </details>

                                        <summary><h4>New project intake and assessment methods</h4></summary>
                                        <p>Where ISC’s main housing and infrastructure programming has a Priority Ranking Framework that emphasizes health and safety, the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative uses a simple idea submission form that emphasizes projected impact on socioeconomic outcomes;
                                        </p>
                                    </details>

                                        <p>The Impact Canada Terms and Conditions were used to fund projects outside the Terms and Conditions of ISC’s Capital Facilities and Maintenance Program – specifically, projects off reserve and/or that are intended to generate community revenue are prohibited under ISC’s main program;</p>
                                    </details>

                                        <summary><h4>Transferring funding responsibility to an Indigenous partner</h4></summary>
                                        <p>The Project Plan ISC submitted to Impact Canada indicated it may work through an Indigenous partner to deliver funding. Using this permission, ISC worked to craft a special contribution agreement that handed funding control and responsibility to one of its main partners, the Council for the Advancement of Economic Development Officers, allowing the initiative to be administered with speed and flexibility.</p>

                                        <summary><h4>Co-development and co-investment with Indigenous partners</h4></summary>
                                        <p>The innovative nature of the project made it an ideal opportunity for co-development with Indigenous partners. ISC engaged an Indigenous Steering Committee to determine the focus areas, eligibility and assessment criteria for the Initiative, and subsequently to select projects to recommend for approval. ISC also worked with Indigenous architects and academics in the design of the initiative.

                            <p>The following four (4) main objectives encompass this Initiative:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Deliver social and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.</li>
                                <li>Take a collaborative approach by establishing new partnerships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities and organizations, including private and not-for-profit sectors.</li>
                                <li>Implement various sizes and types of projects in a range of communities – large or small, on and off reserve, remote and urban across the country.</li>
                                <li>Share lessons learned from implemented projects. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>5.1 Effective and Efficient Government: the Original Rationale for the Initiative</h3>
                            <h4>5.1.1 Reforming the ISC Housing Service Delivery Model</h4>
                            <p>ISC’s current funding approach for housing is needs-based and focused on health and safety and is limited to an on reserve context (for First Nations). Funding cannot typically be used for projects that generate community revenue nor does it integrate well with other programming that focus on social supports (i.e. wrap around services). The Initiative pilots an outcomes-based approach to housing that allows greater flexibility of funding – where Indigenous people identify why their proposed approach will lead to better outcomes in community wellbeing, and spend their funding accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The Initiative also focuses on finding ways to make it easier for Indigenous peoples to live in safe, appropriate homes. For example, a significant proportion of First Nation individuals live off-reserve and are largely ineligible for targeted federal infrastructure programming. To address this, the Initiative accepted applications from Indigenous organizations and individuals offering housing ideas that addressed the needs of First Nations living on or off reserve, Inuit and Metis.</p>

                            <h3>5.2 Process Outcomes</h3>

                                        </summary>
                                        <p>While not an intended outcome, the initial conception of the initiative as a ‘challenge’ sparked public conversation about the federal government’s approach to Indigenous housing. Coverage by media outlets such as CBC referenced ‘the Hunger Games of Indigenous housing’ and thought leaders such as Indigenous lawyer and professor Pamela Palmater weighed in; Palmater was interviewed by Aboriginal People’s Television Network and the Senior Director of Housing and Infrastructure at ISC was subsequently interviewed as well. Chiefs, notably in Ontario, expressed their views to the federal government and in the media – in Ontario, Chief Shining Turtle of Whitefish River First Nation was adamantly opposed to the challenge while Chief Maracle of Mohawks Bay of Quinte announced his community would submit an application. Public discussion focused on the historic level of investment in Indigenous housing, and the competitive mechanism. In this way, the federal government had an unanticipated and difficult but ultimately productive engagement on the issue.</p>

                                        <summary><h4>5.2.2 New Talent Mobilized</h4></summary>
                                        pNew talent has certainly been mobilized through the cohort of 24 innovators selected to participate. The group is a range of innovators from across the country – from seasoned housing developers, to Chiefs, to social service delivery practitioners, to individuals who simply have good ideas. For new entrants to the area, resources provided include project coordination funding, hands-on mentorship from Indigenous architects and funding to engage their communities and refine their ideas into an implementable proposal, while expanding their skills and expertise. Notably, one project is assisted by Indigenous architecture students from the University of Manitoba; with a dedicated focus on Indigenous elements of architecture.

                                        <p>The Initiative takes a collaborative approach by establishing new partnerships among Indigenous communities and organizations, including private and not-for-profit sectors. These new partnership models intend to provide mentorship and capacity building and support. This approach aims to increase collaboration, working relationships, and knowledge sharing among Innovators and their communities. Notable partnerships include:</p>
                                        <ul>

                                    <p>As of May 2020, the Initiative is supporting 24 projects intended to expand the level of innovation in Indigenous housing (products) and housing service delivery. A full list of projects is available in the Annex, but notable ideas include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The North Bay Friendship Centre’s development of a housing complex with wrap-around services for individuals who are ready to leave the emergency shelter system;</li>
                                        <li>The development of a ‘universal utility core,’ a model for an energy-efficient and affordable housing core that could be rapidly produced and shipped in several Indigenous-specific designs;</li>
                                        <li>A ‘Tree-to-Home’ project that leverages community lumber and skills to build local houses and jobs; and,</li>

                                    <p>The Initiative aims to increase community self-determination, resilience, capacity, and economic development and potentially leverage funds to complement the Government of Canada’s investment of up to $2 million for implementation of each of the selected projects. The Initiative aims to support housing ideas that decrease dependency on external resources, strengthen local economies by sourcing local labour and materials, and create jobs. This includes project ideas using alternative building materials and decreasing energy costs and environmental impacts. Skills and capacity development were built directly into the Initiative design at the direction of the Steering Committee in two concrete ways:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>one of the six focus areas for the Initiative focused on ‘using the home for empowerment, capacity building and support for local businesses’; and,</li>
                                        <li>An assessment criterion to prioritize those projects that draw upon the skills, material and services of the local community.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In addition to these aspects of the Initiative, as noted above, the Accelerator is a significant capacity-building opportunity. Innovators have been paired with mentors to develop their ideas over the course of up to 18 months.

                                    <p>In addition to the direct investment the Initiative is making in innovators and their projects, the Steering Committee expects virtually all of the projects to leverage part of the funding they require. Four aspects of the Initiative are intended to assist with this process:</p>

The Initiative aims to improve community and individual health and well-being, including increasing housing stability and substance use disorder treatment, improving mental health and access to health and social services in urban areas, and reducing homelessness. Key to this element are several projects that have proposed either more affordable housing or housing complexes with wrap-around services and community supports built in.

                                        <p>The challenge prize model was adapted to better suit the Indigenous context. Co-development with Indigenous peoples from conception to implementation enabled ISC to express its broader shared objective to transfer services to Indigenous communities. From start to finish, the Initiative was developed, launched and operationalized in partnership with Indigenous people: </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The Initiative was co-created with an Indigenous Steering Committee, comprised of six prominent Indigenous individuals with expertise in Indigenous housing from across Canada. The Indigenous Steering Committee members were involved in the design of the Initiative, from identifying the focus areas, to the application process, to the defining of assessment criteria and decision-making process. Initially, the Steering Committee’s involvement would have been completed after recommending the projects for investment and support to the Minister of Indigenous Services Canada, but they have agreed to continue overseeing the Initiative throughout its implementation.</li>
                                            <li>Indigenous firms Donna Cona and Minokaw Consulting provided facilitation services to bring the Committee together for its discussions and worked with the steering committee to develop a consensus decision making model used for decision making.</li>
                                            <li>Members of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada’s Indigenous Taskforce assisted the Committee in the Initiative’s design, participated in the technical committee that advised the Steering Committee on costs and technical needs for selected projects, and are now acting as mentors to Innovators.

                            <p>Through the Initiative, ISC and its partners have tried a number of service delivery aspects that are new to the Department.

                            <ul>
                                <li>an initiative designed by an Indigenous Steering Committee resulted in services that are more likely to respond to communities’ needs and priorities;</li>
                                <li>increased flexibility of terms and conditions made innovators more likely to achieve their intended outcomes, and notably whether these outcomes go beyond what the Capital Facilities and Maintenance Program can deliver (such as revenue generation, welcoming urban spaces, or transitional and supportive housing for vulnerable populations).
                                </li>
                                <li>the Accelerator’s gated process, that puts an emphasis on impact through design, made for designs and Operations and Maintenance plans that out-performed standard construction housing in terms of years of use, maintenance and energy needs, or general livability;</li>
                                <li>the network-building approach taken through the Accelerator has resulted in leverage of in-kind services in a sustainable manner that should be scaled up;</li>
                                <li>providing a ‘letter of intent’ indicating potential departmental funding for the project, is effective in supporting efforts to leverage private or non-profit funding;
                                </li>
                                <li>A third party organization (Cando, in this case) may have been able to leverage efficiencies by delivering the program.</li>
                                <li>The network building approach, innovator supports, and tools developed support capacity in communities (instead of communities relying on consultants). </li>
