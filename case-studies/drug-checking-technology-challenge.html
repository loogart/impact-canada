                                technology. This would allow the community of people who use drugs and those who support
                                them to make more informed decisions, based on the composition of a drug and to reduce
                                harm.</p>

                                until spring 2021, the Challenge already features an impressive set of inventions and
                                preliminary positive insights about its overall impact.

                                the Government, and deliver meaningful and measurable social, economic and environmental
                                impacts for Canadians. The case study will also provide an overview of the objectives

                                        <p>Challenge prizes are designed to have a ‘look and feel’ that is very
                                            different from the
                                            types of funding programs that governments and their usual stakeholders are
                                            accustomed
                                            to running and participating in. This strategy of openness and transparency
                                            has the dual
                                            purpose of attracting new talent (and with new talent, new ideas – see
                                            below), but also
                                            of better engaging the general public on the broader policy issue(s) at
                                            hand. By working
                                            in the open through a challenge prize, its host creates opportunities to
                                            communicate in
                                            a strategic manner with the public on matters that are relevant to its
                                            central mandate,
                                            in a style that may be more attractive to a broader audience than
                                            traditional
                                            communications approaches may be. It is possible to think of challenge
                                            prizes in this
                                            manner as ‘flagship’ initiatives that might themselves have a narrow scope,
                                            but which
                                            have the potential to shed light on the broader social or environmental
                                            issues at hand.

                                        <p>Challenge Prizes aim to engage a diversity of actors and attract new players
                                            into an existing field of work. The majority of the 24 initial applicants to
                                            the Challenge were new applicants to government, having never been funded
                                            through Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program. The
                                            semi-finalist and finalist pool represent a cross-section of
                                            well-established research and academic institutions, and new technology

                                            following significant and thoughtful stakeholder and citizen engagement, the
                                            objective of the challenge shifted from developing new technologies for
                                            enforcement purposes (e.g., for use by police), to drug checking devices for
                                            front-line service delivery environments (e.g. supervised consumption sites,
                                            overdose prevention sites, public health centres, etc.). Throughout the
                                            Understand and Design phases of challenge planning, it became clear where
                                            there was a need and an opportunity to intervene: we would launch a
                                            challenge to provide more information to people who use drugs, and those who
                                            support them, so they can make informed choices. </p>

                                            user for the solutions are respected - people who use drugs and those who
                                            support them - the challenge has used multiple methods. First, applicants
                                            must demonstrate how they have incorporated the end user perspective into
                                            the development of their drug checking technology throughout the challenge.
                                            Second, people with lived and living experience have also been incorporated
                                            into jury discussions and decision-making. And finally, when COVID-19 forced
                                            the planning team away from planned in-person demonstrations of the final
                                            three devices, a practical review process was put in place, wherein four
                                            members of the drug checking community with lived and living expertise
                                            participated in virtual demonstrations with innovators, and provided
                                            feedback both to innovators, and to the jury, as they engaged in Stage 3
                                            deliberations. These actions helped to ensure continual engagement from

                                            Challenges are very often ‘staged’ such that solvers need to graduate
                                            through a series of successive ‘gates’ leading to the award of the final
                                            prize. While the literature generally sees enhancements to skills and
                                            capacities within organizations as ‘by-products’, and things that are
                                            generally overlooked by challenge sponsors (McKinsey & Company, 2009), for

                                            that will allow those who use drugs to make informed decisions about their
                                            consumption, based on the composition of the drug itself. This type of
                                            challenge is largely seen as a way for government to intervene where there
                                            is little or no market incentive to develop a technology that would (if it
                                            existed) lead to improved socioeconomic or environmental outcomes that have
                                            public value. The challenge has helped bring forward a number of promising

                            <blockquote>
                                Challenges aim to solve big problems and accelerate progress towards ambitious goals,
                                and have a history of producing major breakthroughs in human knowledge and practice.
                                They do this by shining a light on an issue or opportunity and providing an incentive
                                for innovators and investors to make meeting the challenge a priority.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Challenges are open innovation approaches, designed to provide incentives (both financial
                                and non-financial) to encourage a broad set of innovators to tackle problems where
                                solutions are not apparent. Challenges typically employ a series of stages to move
                                innovators through to the ultimate goal of solving a given problem. Instead of
                                prescribing a particular set of specifications, those that issue Challenges in the
                                public sector are most often looking for the most promising solutions to meet a set of
                                defined criteria. Challenges can act as “pull mechanism”, where a sponsoring
                                organization, such as government, identifies a problem, publicizes criteria, and awards
                                innovators if and when they can measurably improve on a given outcome that the
                                organization is looking to achieve. </p>

                            <p>The number of overdoses and deaths caused by opioids, including fentanyl, has risen
                                sharply and continues to rise: 17,602 apparent opioid-related deaths occurred between
                                January 2016 and June 2020. Between January and June 2020, 75% of accidental apparent
                                opioid-related deaths involved fentanyl or fentanyl analogues. Governments,
                                non-government organizations, health and public safety professionals, and Canadians
                                across the country have been responding to this crisis in an effort to save lives.

                                        <p>A key pillar of the Government of Canada’s approach to the opioid overdose
                                            crisis is using a harm reduction approach – measures that reduce the
                                            negative effects of drugs and substances on individuals and communities,
                                            without requiring abstinence. Drug checking is a harm reduction measure
                                            where people have their drugs tested to find out what is in them, including
                                            if they contain toxic substances or potent drugs like fentanyl.

                                        <p>In October 2018, the Drug Checking Technology Challenge was launched to
                                            improve on drug checking technology to allow the community of people who use
                                            drugs and those who support them to make informed decisions based on the

                                            samples in advance. Finalists were each given a block of time to use their
                                            drug checking device to identify the composition of the sample. A report
                                            with results was provided to the Jury. This process helped to verify the
                                            performance of the finalists’ devices against some of the technical judging
                                            criteria (e.g., accuracy and quantification).
