                  </h2>
                  <p>In Canada and around the world, we are already experiencing the impacts of climate change: hotter summers, more intense storms, more frequent floods, and a reduction in biodiversity. The science is clear: the Earth is warming, global and local climates are changing, and human activities are the primary cause. To avoid a dangerous level of warming, Canada is committed to cutting our global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40-45% by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
                  </p>

                  </h2>
                  <p>In September 2021, in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), the Impact and Innovation Unit launched a multi-year program of research on climate change. The Program of Applied Research on Climate Action in Canada (PARCA Canada) will apply <a class="text-light" href="https://impact.canada.ca/en/behavioural-science">behavioural science (BeSci)</a> insights and methods with robust policy analysis to promote climate action.
                  </p>
                  <p>Together with ECCC and NRCan, we will learn about how Canadians think, feel and act in response to climate change and the risks it creates. We will then develop and test, online and in the real world, specific behaviourally-informed solutions with the potential to reduce GHG emissions and promote climate adaptation at the individual and community level. This work will generate new insights on a rapid timeframe and use them to inform policy development, program design, and public communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>A large network of internal and external partners, including partners at multilateral organizations and an advisory committee of subject matter experts, will guide the research program to help ensure its relevance, rigour, and impact.
                  </p>

                  <p>In the scoping phase, we will first examine areas with real potential for improving climate and environmental outcomes using behavioural science-based methods and reviewing relevant scientific literature. Key outcomes will relate to transportation, home energy use, waste management, engagement with nature, preparedness for extreme weather, and disaster recovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>In parallel, we will implement a longitudinal study (public opinion research) with a large and nationally representative sample of Canadians to gather data and track changes over time. The robust, quantitative evidence generated by this study will help identify where there is potential for promoting greater individual climate and environmental action.

                  <p>Evidence and insights from the scoping and longitudinal data collection will inform a series of rapid online studies and experiments to assess factors that can enable or prevent behaviour change.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each online experiment will be set up as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to isolate each experimental condition’s impact. As the gold standard in experimentation, RCTs are the best way of determining whether a strategy is working or which strategy would work best.

                                  <p>Dr. Joe Árvai is the Director of the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and the Dana and David Dornsife Professor of Psychology at the University of Southern California. He began his career as an oceanographer but quickly pivoted to conduct research on how people formulate their attitudes and beliefs—and how they ultimately make decisions—about environmental issues such as climate change. His current research unfolds on two fronts: First, Joe and his research team conduct research aimed at improving our understanding of how people instinctively—and often in a biased fashion—approach judgment and decision-making in situations where environmental, social, and economic priorities intersect. Second, Joe and his team develop and test critical reasoning and decision-support tools aimed at helping policy-makers, business leaders, and consumers to make better, science-based judgments and choices. In light of current events, a large fraction of the current research carried out by Joe and his team focuses on overcoming obstacles and biases associated with political partisanship, the powerful influence of heated emotions, and misinformation in online and traditional media. In addition to his research, Joe teaches classes on judgment and decision-making about sustainability, and he appears frequently as a commentator in newspapers, online, and on television. He also serves as a member of the U.S. EPA's Science Advisory Board, and as an advisor to a broad range of government agencies, companies, and NGOs. He can be found on Twitter at @DecisionLab.

                                  <p>Dr. Besley studies public opinion about science and scientists' opinions about the public. His goal is to help science communicators be more effective by helping them consider evidence-based and strategic communication choices. He also does research aimed at understanding how peoples' views about decision-makers and decision processes (i.e., trustworthiness an fairness beliefs) affect their overall perceptions of science and technology (S&T) with potential health or environmental impacts.</p>
                                  <p> More generally, Dr. Besley explores the relationships between media use, public engagement activities, and health and environmental risk perceptions. His research has touched on public perceptions of agricultural biotechnology (i.e., genetic engineering), energy technologies (i.e., nuclear energy, hydrogen fuel cells), and nanotechnology. He has also conducted research into science communication training.</p>
                                      <p>Dr. Besley has published more than 100 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters. This work has appeared in high-ranking journals including Risk Analysis, Science Communication, Public Understanding of Science, and the Journal of Risk Research as well as a range of edited volumes. He has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and a range of foundations. He is the associate editor for risk communication for Risk Analysis. He completed his doctorate (Communication) at Cornell University and both bachelor (Journalism) and master's (Public Administration) degrees at Carleton University.

                                    <p>A strong belief in the importance of curiosity, the value of experimentation, and the promise of behavioural policy has led Christine to pursue a career translating research into action to help solve applied problems within the public sector. Christine currently works as a Senior Behavioural Scientist with the BC Behavioural Insights Group (BC BIG). She holds a BSc (Psychology and Biology) from Queen's University as well as a MSc and PhD in Social and Environmental Psychology from the University of Victoria, where she applied behavioural and social science insights to address decision-making challenges related to sustainability, including BC's Clean Energy Vehicles Program. Her subsequent Postdoctoral Fellowship at Simon Fraser University also focused on sustainable transportation.

                                    <p>An anthropologist by training and an interdisciplinarian by design, Terre's work concerns sustainable development in the context of debates about cultural meanings, environmental values, perceived risk, environmental and ecosystem health. Difficult environmental policy dilemmas and the qualitative and quantitative methods that might resolve these are of particular interest. Locally, her work pertains to First Nations interest in land management, oil and gas development, and regulatory contexts. Globally, her research incorporates biodiversity management and politics, and the perceived risk of new technologies (biotechnology, fracking and nanotechnology). Terre is also a board member or research scientist for several international initiatives that seek to better integrate social science research into policy analysis normally led by the natural and engineering scientists.
