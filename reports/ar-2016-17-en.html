                                    There is a recognized need for the government to innovate, experiment and find new
                                    and better ways to address persistent problems that traditional approaches have
                                    failed to solve.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Government of Canada is committed to innovating in program and policy design to
                                    deliver better outcomes for Canadians. This includes a commitment to employ rigorous
                                    experimental approaches to test and scaleup programs that work.
                                </p>
                                <p>The second annual report of the Privy Council Office’s (PCO) Innovation Hub (“the
                                    Hub”) focuses on how it advances this agenda through its work to improve program
                                    results, support broader systems change, and proactively engage with stakeholders
                                    and other governments. The report highlights:

                                    <h3>1.2 What we're talking about when we talk about innovation</h3>
                                </summary>
                                <p>Too often innovation is understood to simply mean doing something new, interesting,
                                    or novel. Used in this way, the term can lose its meaning.</p>
                                <p>The Hub takes a specific view of what innovation is to guide its work. In our
                                    context, innovation means applying new insights, resources, technologies, or
                                    approaches that can be demonstrated to improve outcomes for the public compared to
                                    conventional ways of doing things. Demonstrating the effectiveness of an innovation
                                    requires, where possible, using rigorous evaluation and structured experimental
                                    methods to generate evidence of impact.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the coming year, the Hub will be working with government departments along with
                                    external partners to promote a shared view and approach on public sector innovation
                                    and experimentation.
                                </p>

                                            <h5>It’s not about the space</h5>This year the Hub moved from its original
                                            location to more traditional offices within PCO. We learned that while
                                            functional collaboration and workspace is important, the most critical
                                            element to pursuing innovation in government is getting the right team of
                                            people in place in an environment that promotes productivity as well as
                                            creativity.

                                            <h5>It’s all about outcomes</h5>Initially the Hub was set up to promote the
                                            use of “innovation tools” in government. Through our work, we were always
                                            committed to measuring and achieving impact to improve results for the
                                            public. However, it became clear that we needed to place a more explicit
                                            emphasis on implementing solutions with partners rather than promoting tools
                                            for their own sake.

                                <p>The Hub was originally established in 2015 to help transform the way in which the
                                    Federal Public Service does its business by exploring how new policy and program
                                    tools can help address complex public policy challenges. The Hub is committed to

                                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Statistics Canada (StatsCan) is looking for alternative approaches to encourage more people to fill out surveys to address the steady decline in response rates observed in recent years. StatsCan and the Hub decided to focus initial efforts on the Farm Financial Survey which provides critical information on the effects of agriculture programs and policies on farms across Canada.
                                </p>
                                <h4>The Innovation</h4>
                                <p>Using behavioural insights principles, we worked with the Behavioral Economics in Action Research Centre (BEAR) at the University of Toronto to co-design a new touch-point  a reminder letter to encourage those that had not yet filled out the survey to do so. Two versions of the reminder letter were tested against a control group with the most successful letter seeing an almost 7% improvement on average across Canada compared to not providing a letter at all. The effects of the intervention were even higher in certain regions like Alberta, where performance was over 15% better compared to the control group.
                                </p>
                                <h4>The Impact</h4>
                                <p>The trial produced a series of findings that can have lasting impact. For example, StatsCan has mainstreamed this innovative approach into this survey. There is also the potential to scale these results in applying lessons to other surveys. The main impact is in helping improve the evidence base to inform the development of programs and policies to support farmers.

                            <h4>The Innovation
                            </h4>
                            <p>The Hub worked with its partners to put in place a “user centered” design challenge to improve the application process by taking into account the views, needs, experiences of users. This process generated a series of concepts for IRCC to test to make the process more predictable, friendly, transparent and responsive.
                            </p>
                            <h4>The Impact</h4>
                            <p>The design challenge generated new evidence and insights about user experiences that has informed a number of service design improvements. For example, information guides and forms were simplified to make them easier to understand submission processes were streamlined and a change in the communications approach at call centres has generated positive feedback from clients and has been mainstreamed. In addition, a case study was developed that was presented at various Government of Canada management tables to exemplify how a user centered design approach could be implemented in a public sector context.

                                <h4>Lessons Learned: Co-design is essential
                                </h4>
                                <p>Working as a team with partner department creates the greatest chance for lasting culture change. As a result of this collaboration, IRCC created ‘change leaders’ who returned to their units and shared their new knowledge about what clients really care about across the organization, from frontline staff to policy makers and communications.</p>

                    <h2>5.0 Moving Forward
                    </h2>
                    <p>After its launch in February 2015, the Hub gradually deepened and broadened its activities to promote innovative tools and approaches in government by pursuing a range of trial projects. 2016-2017 saw the impact and scope of the Hub’s work expand. In the past year, the Hub pursued systems changes to enable greater innovation and experimentation across the federal government and began to see tangible and positive results emerge from its project work in improving outcomes for the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>The start of 2017-2018 marks an important year for the Hub that will see a number of changes take place. New opportunities will emerge as the Hub spearheads the development and implementation of the Impact Canada Fund announced in Budget 2017. As a result, the Hub will expand its work significantly in areas related to innovative financing and experimental programming. In addition, further results from project trials already in the field are expected this year, which will help reinforce the value of applying behavioural insights and design innovations, backed by rigorous evidence of effec- tiveness, to help solve complex policy challenges.
