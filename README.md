## 2. Structural Changes to Impact Canada Site

* Create Other Initiatives section on IC homepage and add back-end functionality 
    1. Back-end functionality to create Other Initiatives similar to Create Challenge
    2. Leverage same template as Challenges

* Allow for different images between Impact Canada Homepage and a Challenge Page
    1. Change functionality so that Main Challenge Image is no longer directly added to Impact Canada Homepage
    2. Requires functionality to update Main Page separate from Challenge Pages

* Merge all News Items from Challenges and Other Initiatives into one page
    1. Back-End - We still create a News Item, but the option for Which Challenge is eliminated. News items will automatically go to a News Page
    2. Current functionality: Adding a News Items must be accompanied with  an identified Challenge (i.e. where does the news item go?)

* Challenge - Update back-end configuration for new look and feel
    1. New location for Challenge Details - 
    2. Now at the bottom of the Challenge Homepage, and every page for a Challenge (i.e. Results, Connect, etc.) 
    3. We can keep the back-end “sections functionality” for successful migration...or not.
    4. Keep the admin tabs where we can add new pages easily

* Add Impact Canada Advisory Committee Members to About Page
    1.  content from IIU Page (canada.ca)
